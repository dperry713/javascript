## File Structure

- `combined_student_info.html`: The main HTML file containing all the code

## How to Run

1. Download the `combined_student_info.html` file
2. Open the file in a web browser

## Code Overview

The HTML file contains three main sections:

1. Task 1: Defines and displays basic and extended student information
2. Task 2: Demonstrates variable reassignment
3. Task 3: Shows the use of console.log (output redirected to the webpage)

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS for better styling
- Implement form inputs for dynamic student information
- Create separate JavaScript files for better code organization
